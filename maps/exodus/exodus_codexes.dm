		<body>\
		<h4>How to get along with and not kill your newfound coworkers, employees, and supervisors</h4><br><br>\
		<b>Section one:</b>Why are they here?<br><br>\
		<p>You are very likely wondering why the Vox are even being allowed to work on the station. While the full details are actually classified, we can give a brief story. Six months ago as of this writing, one particular Vox ship hailed a Nanotrasen facility and expressed the wish to trade on honest and open terms. For the most part, it appeared to be a typical encounter until the Vox started making their requests. The Arkship from whence these particular Vox hailed from desired to outsource excess laborers in exchange for credits with which to purchase goods from NanoTrasen and other organizations legitimately. This was entirely unprecidented, and naturally NanoTrasen Command was skeptical.</p>\
		<p>Many months of careful deliberation, debate, and negotiations were undertaken before an agreement was reached. Slow integration of Vox employees at low-security NanoTrasen facilities began, and over time, their broad skillset, clever nature, and rapid pace of learning became a valuable asset to the whole of NanoTrasen. Today, many of the Vox employees occupy mid-level positions, and a handful even are employed within the NanoTrasen command structure. Rest assured that any Vox placed in a command position is to be <b>loyalty-implanted</b>. While this is not standard procedure, it is part of the contract with the Vox Arkship.</p>\
		<p>Again: <b>Any Vox employee transferring to or holding a command-level position should have or receive a loyalty implant</b>. Failure to do so is a serious oversight in security, and any command-position Vox refusing the procedure is in breach of contract and should have their employment terminated immediately and incarcerated until they can be extradited to their Arkship. As an additional measure of safety, all Vox employees are issued NanoTrasen uniforms tailored to them with suit sensors locked at maximum settings.</p><br>\
		<b>Section two:</b>Physiological Concerns<br><br>\
		<p>The first and foremost thing to know about Vox is that Oxygen, the very gas that we all know, love, and need, is considerably toxic to all Vox. Brief exposures are tolerable, but such incidents should be quickly followed by administration of anti-toxin after the incident has been resolved. Vox should work only in pure-nitrogen environments or with nitrogen internals on continuously. Atmospherics should be polite and accomodating when refilling Vox nitrogen bottles, as they need it to survive. Futhermore, Oxygen-based cryogenics is very likely toxic to Vox, even if they are equipped with internals.</p>\
		<p>Research regarding nitrogen-based cryogenics is underway. Until such time, ensure that any surgical or medical procedures are done with appropriate gas mixtures of oxygen-free internals. Surgery may prove challenging as Vox anatomy is a large unknown. Additionally, Vox show remarkable healing capabilities, especially for minor abrasions, so extra but careful force may be needed. Additionally, it is hypothesized that their intolerance of oxygen and lack of oxygen-based metabolic processes leads to exceptional longevity, though Vox decline to comment on the matter.</p>\
		<p>Vox show a remarkable tolerance for both temperature and pressure. They can withstand wide ranges of temperature and can function tolerably in low-pressure environments. However, they still need pressure suits for open space. These remarkable qualities lead some researchers to hypothesize that Vox are in fact genetically-engineered, but this is pure skepticism at this point.</p><br>\
		<b>Section three:</b>Social Considerations<br><br>\
		<p>Vox have never been known to be politely sociable creatures. They regularly insult non-vox with jeers and derogatory terms, in their eyes. In fact, this has become such a tradition within Vox culture that most Vox refer to non-Vox by these words as titles without giving it much of a thought. In addition, communicating with Vox may be a chore at times. While most Vox understand the common language fairly well, their speech is often stunted and simplified, and they often struggle with unusual or complex words. Thus many Vox prefer their simplified version of common that, while improper and crude, still conveys meaning enough to be a productive member of a crew.</p>\
		<p>Vox are curious and inquisitive creatures by nature and generally enjoy tinkering. While most of their tinkering is harmless, it is wise to monitor any construction or station modification projects they may have. Vox also tend to be somewhat stand-offish, flighty, and generally avoid conflicts with one major exception. Vox in command positions assume a much more dominant role and seek to maintain order within their department. Vox appear to be very fickle about using resources and materials, and this includes personnel. They also appear to obsess about organization, efficiency, and cleanliness.</p>\
		<p>In the event that a Vox employee should be incapacitated or killed on board a NanoTrasen vessel or facility, <b>DO NOT</b>, under any circumstance, space, incinerate, otherwise destroy, or leave the remains behind at the end of work shifts. As per the contract between this particular Arkship and NanoTrasen, all Vox remains are to be returned to the arkship at the earliest possibility. Deliberate ejection or destruction of Vox remains are grounds for contractual termination, while incarceration and retention of Vox remains carries a heavy corporate fine. <b>This fine will be deducted from the accounts of all staff held responsible.</b></p><br>\
		<b>Section four:</b>Vox Culture and You<br><br>\
		<p>Vox culture is as strange and alien as they come. Additionally, Vox are incredibly secretive about the subject. What is known is that they are a largely nomadic culture that resides primarily in Arkships along with support groups of combat and transport vessels. Many Vox refer to trees as being important, but exactly what they mean by this is still a large unknown.</p>\
		<p>The typical Vox, and the only type to be approved for labor within NanoTrasen, are the Vox Primalis. They are roughly the same size as the average human and have bird-like digits on both upper and lower limbs, as well as powerful and admittedly dangerous beaks. Vox Armalis are considerably larger, stronger, and more aggressive and should be treated with extreme caution if encountered. Graciously, the Armalis are not approved nor seek employment and are generally seen as a kind of 'elite guard' within Vox society.</p>\
		<p>Vox Apex and Vox Auralis are still, as of this writing, shrouded mystery. None have been encountered by non-Vox, nor do Vox openly discuss them with outsiders. It is known that the Apex are a key aspect of Vox society and perform some sort of leadership role. Auralis, on the other hand, are never openly mentioned by Vox, and their existence is only known through scraps of recordings of raids. The role that the Auralis play is a complete mystery.</p>\
		<p>It should be noted that attempting to pry information from a Vox about their culture can have the effect of irritating them considerably. Casual conversation is generally acceptable, but sensitive subjects will visibly, literally ruffle their feathers, and a change of subject at this point is strongly recommended.</p><br>\
		<p>In closing, we hope this manual has been helpful in familiarzing you with the particulars of Vox and working with them, and we hope that your work shifts with them are pleasant and productive. If you have any concerns or questions regarding a particular employee or their employment in general, please direct them to your present command staff or the Central Personnel Authority.<br>\

	<ol type="1">
	<li><h2>General Security and Restrictions</h2>
	<ol type="1"><li>Secure Areas: Important areas that can be accessed from main halls.
	<ol type="1"><li>Tech Storage: Only the Captain, CSO, or Chief Engineer should enter this room, and only they are permitted to authorize others do so on their behalf.</li>
	<li>Teleporter Room: Only Head Staff should enter or authorize others to enter the Teleporter Room at any time.</li>
	<li>EVA Storage: Only staff with normal access to EVA Storage, such as Security and Engineering, are permitted entry to EVA storage without authorization. Use of EVA equipment without authorization from Head Staff is impermissible to non-Heads.</li>
	<li>The Bridge: Only Head Staff and authorized individuals are permitted entry to the Bridge</li></ol></li>
	<li>High Security Areas: Critical areas, and areas with special procedures.
	<ol type="1"><li>Self Destruct Room/Vault: To be secured against entry by any personnel unless two concurring Heads or the Captain deem access necessary.</li>
	<li>Armoury: Only the Captain or Head of Security have access normally. All heads are authorised to access the Tactical Equipment armoury during Code Red or above. Blast doors are to remain secured unless the crew is being armed, and only occasional inspections are permitted when accompanied by the Chief of Security or Captain. When arming personnel, priority should be given to members of the crew based on rank and training.</li>
	<li>Warden's Office and Sub-Armoury: Only the Warden and their superiors have normal access. Officers may request equipment from the sub-armory for which paperwork and justification must be provided. Note that emergency situations and elevated alerts may constitute <i>ad oculos</i> justification. Paperwork should still be filed, though disbursement of equipment should not be delayed for paperwork in time-sensitive situations. Filing of armory and sub-armory equipment memoranda is the primary responsibility of the Warden, though the Chief of Security should maintain proper oversight whenever possible.</li>
	<li>AI Core and Upload: Only the Captain and Chief Engineer have access normally. Bolted on Code Blue or above. Individual access to upload no longer permitted on Code Red or above, access must be done with at least two Department Heads. Individual access to the AI Core is restricted in the same way.</li>
	<li>Telecommunications: Only the Captain, Chief Engineer, and Human Resources Director (HRD) are permitted normally. Access is only available, reliably, through the teleporter.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
	<li><h2>Docking and Visitors</h2>
	<ol type="1"><li><h3>Visitors</h3>
	<ol type="1"><li>The NSS Endeavour is encouraged to allow non-hostile visitors permission to dock or otherwise come aboard during normal operating conditions.</li>
	<li>Stationed in the Protectorate system of Pyro, the NSS Endeavour enjoys a limited amount of freedom from United Earth Empire (UEE) Law. While the UEE Navy and UEE Security Force have no permanent presence in Pyro, it is still subject to the laws and protections of the UEE. While a police cruiser is not likely to appear to subjugate lawbreakers, Nanotrasen's charter within the Pyro system and beyond are still contingent upon good legal standing within the UEE proper.</li>
	<li>Fugitives of justice from foreign nations may desire to seek asylum aboard the NSS Endeavour due to its Protectorate status and proximity to UEE borders.</li>
	<li>Only UEE officials may grant or deny asylum at their discretion.</li>
	<li>Fugitives of UEE justice are to be apprehended and detained for a qualified UEE Security Force to the best of the Endeavour's crew's ability.</li>
	<li>Visitors may be granted whatever access the Captain or HRD deems appropriate.</li>
	<li>Visitors may be assigned an escort or searched upon entrance at the Captain or other commanding staff's discretion. However, at no times may crew enter a visitor’s vessel, search a visitor’s vessel, or otherwise infringe on their sovereignty without both proper authorization and cause.</li>
	<li>As with crew, visitors aboard the Endeavour are subject to UEE Law. Likewise, if a visitor breaks the law and flees to their own vessel, security are authorized to pursue and detain said visitor to await justice.</li>
	<li>It is advised that the assigned Captain, HRD, or Internal Affairs Agent (IAA) initiate contact with visitors and mediate any conflicts, legal or otherwise, between the NSS Endeavour and other spacecraft.</li>
	<li>The Captain, HRD, or IAA may lease the private office at arrivals to any visitor at their discretion.</li></ol></li>
	<li><h3>Vessels</h3>
	<ol type="1"><li>All vessels and installations in UEE space, including Protectorate space, are required to obey UEE Law. Vessels outside of UEE territory are sovereign entities and may enforce whatever laws and regulations they see fit aboard their own vessel when not otherwise subject to UEE Law.</li>
	<li>Any personnel aboard a vessel and under the legal authority of that vessel and may be legally fined, arrested, detained, and otherwise punished for infractions of the visitor's laws.</li>
	<li>Vessels belonging to organisations at war with the UEE, or vessels which attack a UEE-protected facility or ship, are not protected by these regulations, nor are vessels openly engaged in criminal activities protected in such a manner.</li>
	<li>As a Nanotrasen installation, the Endeavour's charter requires that it render aid to vessels in distress unless there is undue risk to the Endeavour and its crew in doing so. Duty to render aid includes providing medical aid, engineering assistance, or military protection from declared hostiles or criminals. On Blue alert or above, docking to the Endeavour directly is prohibited without express authorization from the Captain or crewmember acting in such a capacity.</li></ol></li></ol>
	<li><h2>First Contact</h2>
	<p>As there is a reasonable probability that the NSS Endeavour will be in a First Contact situation, the following guidelines have been created to smooth the process:
	</p>
	<ol type="1"><li>Hostility: Determine if an undiscovered species or entity is hostile. This should be fairly easy to determine. Make every effort not to injure or kill a hostile entity regardless of its intelligence. Containment is the preferred course of action. If containment is successful, proceed with the next step. If containment is impossible, lethal force may be necessary, and can be authorised as needed.</li>
	<li>Intelligence: Assuming the species is not overtly hostile, determine how intelligent they are. This can be determined through communication, mathematics, or other tests.</li>
	<li>Communication: The next step should be communication. It is highly unlikely new species will speak or even understand common, or have any ability to translate, but it should be tried in any case. Basic pictograms, mathematical concepts such as prime numbers, or physical constants such as atomic makeup may prove more useful if vocal communication is impossible.</li>
	<li>Diplomacy: If communication is established, and the new species has some form of government or hierarchy that diplomatic contact can be made with, make every effort to open diplomatic communication with this government, a process which should be spearheaded by the IAA or Captain.</li></ol></li>
	<li><h2>Medical Evaluation</h2>
	<p>The Chief Medical Officer may declare any crewman or passenger unfit for duty, and remove them from their position. In this duty, the CMO outranks everyone. However, they will be required to justify their assessment to Nanotrasen Regional Operations. In most legitimate cases, this assessment will be <i>ad oculos</i>, but the CMO's medical license and employment are on the line with each such ruling of duty fitness.<br>
	This regulation, unlike other non-legal regulations, cannot be overruled by the Captain, but can be overruled by an assigned IAA.
	</p></li>
	<li><h2>Weaponry</h2>
	<p>Those non-security personnel who are permitted to carry weaponry other than non-lethal flashes are assumed to be any personnel who have access to weapon(s) in their locker, or who have default authorization to carry them. This includes, but is not limited to, Detective, IAA, and Bartender crewmembers.
	</p><p>Research personnel are permitted to construct, modify, and test weaponry within the Research Wing, and, with approval of the Chief Science Officer (CSO), may bring equipment along on any away missions for the purposes of field testing.
	The Captain, Chief of Security, or Head of Personnel can authorise any crewman or passenger to carry lethal or nonlethal weapons at their discretion, though doing so without need or purpose is a direct violation of corporate regulations and may result in termination of employment and commission.
	</p></li>
	<li><h2>Away Missions</h2>
	<p>A joint exploration mission should be scheduled whenever possible. On any away mission without a Head Staff member, the CSO or Captain is advised to designate a team leader and schedule planned check-ins for safety purposes.
	</p><p>Documented flight plans for individual exploration away missions are optional, and, if desired, should generally be filed by Head Staff. However, no away mission should be delayed for the purposes of filing paperwork, and should instead be filed after the mission if still desired.
	</p></li>
	<li><h3>Expeditions</h3>
	<p>Away missions for the purpose of exploration must be a joint operation between available Science and Command personnel. Only the Chief Science Officer may prohibit any member of science staff from accompanying an exploratory away mission. In addition to the Science division, the Captain may assign other personnel as needed.
	</p><p>A senior team member should be present to lead the team. If necessary, security may be provided by the security team, but defense force personnel should be preferred if extreme danger is expected.
	</p><p>Unless the station is preparing for end-of-shift activities and subsequent departure, expeditions should continue as normal where appropriate.
	</p></li>
	<li><h3>Mining Missions</h3>
	<p>Away missions for the purposes of resource collection are the responsibility of mining personnel aboard. In the event no mining staff or other HRD-appointed personnel are available, Supply may deploy large mining drills in order to engage in resource collection.
	</p></li>
	<li><h3>Other Missions</h3>
	<p>Missions not for exploration or resource collection may be authorized by Head Staff as needed and individually designed for their specific cases.
	</p></li>
	<li><h2>Supply &amp; Operations</h2>
	<p>Receipts are not required to be provided to crew for supply requests. All supply orders are logged on the supply console, and all receipts exist for the benefit of the one who placed the order.
	</p><p>The Quartermaster may, at their discretion, require signed authorizations for any supply orders or materiel retrieved from Supply. This is required for any materiel considered to be Controlled, and encouraged for valuable non-controlled or <i>de facto</i> authorized controlled materiel to ensure proper dispensation and receipt.
	</p></li>
	<li><h2>Stowaways</h2>
	<p>Due to the station's desirability as a habitat for stowaways, it is important that they are handled properly and with due regard to the law. To this end, all Stowaways should be charged appropriately and nominally with UEE Law. This means trespassing and any other charges they may have accrued and the accompanying brig time it may bring. Following the completion of their time served all Stowaways should be placed on restriction (Common-area access only) until such a time as they can be removed safely from the station.
	</p></li>
	<li><h2>Controlled Substances/Items</h2>
	<ol type="1"><li>Controlled substances are any substances that have been restricted or made illegal by the UEE. The current list of controlled substances is as follows:
	<ol type="1"><li>Concentrated extract of Ambrosia Vulgaris or Deus, colloquially "Space Drugs." Note that this does not include the recreational use of Ambrosia while off duty, only the use of its concentrated extract.</li>
	<li>Pure Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, (LSD) sometimes referred to as "Mindbreaker."</li>
	<li>Concentrated toxic extracts of the "Reishi" mushroom, specifically Psilocybin.</li>
	<li>Activated CarpoToxin, or "Zombie Powder."</li>
	<li>Synaptizine, Hyperzine, Oxycodone, and Chloral Hydrate when not used in a medical capacity. Note that Chloral Hydrate may be deemed an appropriate nonlethal method of riot control, but only in extreme circumstances and where lethal force is neither desired nor appropriate.</li>
	<li>"Loyalty" Implants, or any other technology designed to alter behavior involuntarily to produce obedience. Exceptions exist for any Vox employed in a Head Staff position, any Captain, Chief of Security, and IAA.</li></ol></li>
	<li>Controlled Items are items that have been restricted or made illegal by the UEE. The current list of controlled items is as follows:
	<ol type="1"><li>Biological or Chemical Weapons, such as engineered viruses. Phoron gas is considered a chemical weapon when used offensively.</li>
	<li>Military Explosives when not in use by authorized personnel. Such personnel are very limited and include active-duty UEE Military forces, UEE Security forces, and UEE Protectorate Services. Nanotrasen Security should not be confused for UEE Security. Note that constructive explosives, such as any charges used for mining are not subject to this restriction. Phoron-based explosives are considered military weapons.</li>
	<li>Automatic Weapons when not in use by the Military, another authorised department of the UEE, or and otherwise authorized entity. This means any weapon capable of firing multiple shots when the trigger is depressed once, energy or otherwise.</li>
	<li>Any cloning technology designed to rapidly grow an adult clone with fully-developed mental faculties. While Nanotrasen was originally a pioneer of such technology, the UEE soon recognized the far-reaching implications of such technology and has heavily-restricted its usage and dissemination.</li>
	<li>Corporate security forces are considered an "authorized entity" with respect to the above clauses.</li>
	<li>Weaponry in the possession of personnel who have not been authorised to possess it.</li>
	<li>Hacking software which allows a person to subvert access to ship systems, bypass access restrictions or attack a vessels computer network.</li></ol></li></ol></li>
	<li><h2>Research Operations</h2>
	<ol type="1"><li>Science employees are permitted to use their lab spaces as they see fit with the following exceptions:</li>
	<li>Any human experimentation must be done with the consent of the test subject, and must not have an undue risk of life. The Captain may terminate any experiment for safety or ethical purposes at their discretion.</li>
	<li>Self-Experimentation is prohibited and is subject to endangerment charges of both self and others.</li>
	<li>Testing of any explosives with risk of penetrating the hull or causing mass destruction must be done at an away site.</li>
	<li>Small arms and larger weapons must also be tested at an away site if there is risk to the hull.</li>
	<li>Distribution of experimental technology to research personnel for testing is permitted within research areas or at away sites.</li>
	<li>Use of experimental technology in public areas must be authorized on a case-by-case basis by the Captain or Chief of Security.</li>
	<li>Experimental technology may be provided to crew departments for testing and use with the approval of the department head.</li>
	<li>Xenobiological organisms, anomalous entities, and xenoarchaeological finds must remain secured within research areas unless authorized by the Captain or Regional Operations official.</li>
	<li>Science employees are permitted to properly utilize Controlled Substances or Items for the purposes of research provided doing so does not endanger themselves, the Endeavour, or other crewmembers.</li></ol></li></ol>
